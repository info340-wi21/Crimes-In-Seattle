      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

              Our general topic is regarding community incident awareness in Seattle. Oftentimes, we see police or EMT reporting to an incident, however, community members are left without a clear understanding of what happened. This can lead to misinformation being
              spread, and as members of the UW, we have witnessed this ourselves right in the University District and throughout the city. With proper awareness and awareness of their surroundings, people will be able to safely navigate their day. A
              comprehensive app that displays recent incidents that happened in Seattle and specific communities using data from the Seattle Police Department, as well as community input will give community members the information they need to be alerted
              and feel safe.
